- 👋 Hi, I’m @MEIR-0-tpg (it's MEIR_tpg but, Usernames can't contain "_" so i chose "-0-" instead.)
- 👀 I’m interested in Scratch HTML/CSS/JS and Tools/Hacks/Games for School-Chromebooks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Tools/Hacks/Games for School-Chromebooks.
- im 15, and used School-Chromebooks.
- my homeschool blocked EVERYTHING,
- only leaving their websites.
- i didn't know it yet but i was gonna outsmart them!
- Firstly i wanted Minecraft (duh.), then i wanted Youtube, Then i just wanted the browser to work...
- and i got them all, but backwards. browser first then youtube etc.
- oh, and i added games on there too.
- when my school found out (it was my fault, i shouldn't have told my other classmates about it on supervised chats, lol)
- they just simply unblocked my Chromebook. yup. guess they saw i was just too powerful.
- i know, sad, what am i gonna do with this project now?
- my Chromebook is unblocked. so here i am giving it to the internet.
- also you can Remix it but mention me plz.
- i'd like to see what projects youv'e come up with.
